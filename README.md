### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Evan and I'm a big fan of turning over stones to appreciate the universe(s) underneath!

I've got a [blog](https://stanev.dev) where I write about topics such as neuroscience, tech, and open source software.

I'm also active on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ehstanton) -- check it out!
